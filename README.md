## What does it do?

This plugin tracks your files in Remix and allows you to store them in a GIT repository in IPFS.<br>
Each time you commit files and export them it will generate a new IPFS hash for you.<br>
In IPFS you will find your browser's files plus the git repository itself ( .git ).<br>
These hashes are stored in your browser's local storage or you can export them to 3Box.io.<br>

## Do I need 3Box and what is it?

3Box allows you to store user information connected to your Metamask/Wallet address.<br>This means if you move around or clear your browser local storage you can still access your repo's by connecting to 3Box.

You do not need it to use this app. You can store your stuff in IPFS and local storage only if you do not plan to clear that or move around.


## Cloning on desktop

It is a GIT repo. If you wish to clone it on your desktop with IPFS get.

## Why not on Github?
